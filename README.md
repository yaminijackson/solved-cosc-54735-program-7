Write the following phone app. The goal is use material design and widgets. As well as refresh everyone on github and Android Studio.

<strong>PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS:</strong>

You are to write an app that displays information from the model (data) code. You are required to use a support drawlayout with the continents listed via a NavigationView widget. As you select the different continent, then the main display will show a list of countries for the selected continent. You will also use the FAB to add a new country to the continent that is currently showing. If you the user clicks on the country name, then is will show a Toast or Snackbar with the country name.

In the main display, you must use a RecyclerView (you can embed it in default fragments if you want to). I would suggest using a cardview with recyclerview, if you havenâ€™t used it before, but it is not required.
